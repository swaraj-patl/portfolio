  <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
        <p>
        Hey there! I'm <strong>Swaraj</strong>, a self-motivated and detail-oriented web developer with a deep passion for crafting beautiful and functional websites. 
        My journey into web development started with curiosity and turned into a full-blown career. I love solving real-world problems through clean, efficient, and creative code.
        </p>
        <p>
        Whether it’s building a responsive landing page, a dynamic web application, or debugging a tricky issue, I approach every project with the same enthusiasm. 
        I enjoy learning new technologies, and I’m constantly challenging myself to grow and stay updated with industry trends.
        </p>
        <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about tech trends, or sketching UI ideas in my notebook.
